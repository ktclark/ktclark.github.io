			<h2>May 7, 2015</h2>
			<h3>If a hostel in Western Europe costs 10&euro; a night or less, it might be a crackhouse.</h3>
			<p>A good friend of mine, J, let a friend of hers unfamiliar with travel around make a couple hostel reservations, one in Paris, one in Amsterdam. Big mistake. Her friend chose based on price alone, and they actually had roommates who were shooting up in their room. An unpleasant jolt back into reality when your thoughts are on the incredible museum you just went to, or the canal tour you just took, or the fabulous gay couple you just made friends with on the tram ride back.</p>

			<img class="centerimg" src="images/crackhouse.jpg" alt="a dilapidated, 3-story house, with fading paint and mostly boarded up windows" title="Crackhouse">

			<p>Choosing cheap travel options requires planning ahead, comprising, and juggling options. You gotta prioritize between amenities like towels, internet, breakfast, and the number of people in your room, especially those you don't know. Then judge that against price per night and try to get the best value for your money. Good luck! </p>

			<h2>April 30, 2015</h2>
			<h3>When in Rome, the Romans can be assholes.</h3>

			<img class="right" src="images/angryfrenchman.jpg">
			
			<p>A lot of Americans will avoid Paris after their first trip there because people in Paris are arrogant pricks.</p>
			
			<p>Two things: 1. even the French regard Parisians in that manner. To a lesser degree than Americans, of course, but it still exists. It's a little how we look at NYC: it's exorbitantly expensive, you might get bitched out by someone talking 500 words per minute because you stepped where they were going to step, and it's incredibly vibrant, positively dripping with a culture you can't see anywhere else in the world. </p>
	
			<img class="left" src="images/americaninparis.jpg" alt="a disgruntled frenchman wearing a beret and a moustache sits on a bench next to an american man wearing a baseball cap and a huge camera around his neck and has a speech bubble that says 'Howdy!'; the Eiffel Tower in the background" title="Americans in Paris">
			
			<p>And, 2. France is not the US. This may come as a shock, but most countries aren't. On a whole, American culture is optimistic, outgoing, and friendly. You get a smile just for smiling, and you can have a superficial conversation with pretty much anyone, at any time. In my travels around Europe, people have told me that they can tell right off the bat that I'm American solely because I smile too much. In France, especially in Paris, don't be offended just because someone doesn't smile back. For most people, a smile doesn't automatically earn a smile in return, and really, if you smile that much, you're probably doing something questionable. Like being American. </p>

			<p>tl:dr: Americans are not representative of every person and culture on the planet. Not every culture is as obscenely friendly, outwardly happy, and expectant of instant gratification as Americans are, but that doesn't automatically mean they're assholes. It just means that they learned their behavior in a different cultural context than Americans do.</p>

			<h2>April 23, 2015</h2>
			
			<h3>When you're relying on public transport, make sure to keep an eye on the clock.</h3>
			
			<img class="left" src="images/versaillesclock.jpg" alt="a clock with a royal blue background, the golden face of Louis XIV surrounded by rays of sun in the middle, the hands of the clock end in fleur de lys, numbers around the edge as roman numerals with fleur de lys between each, then a golden wreath around the whole clock, cut off stone statues are the setting" title="Clock at Versailles Palace">
			
			<p>There's absolutely no problem in walking a couple miles to where you're laying your head on any particular night. Especially in Europe, where people walk between destinations a lot more frequently than in the US.</p> 
			
			<p>That being said, if you end up stranded 7 miles from your hostel at 2 in the morning in a thunderstorm because you weren't watching the clock to catch the last metro, you might regret a life choice or two. So, always be aware of when the last transport leaves, whether it's feasible to walk the distance instead, and what the time is if it's not feasible and there are no alternatives.</p>

			<h2>April 16, 2015</h2>
			
			<h3>Become best friends with a bartender.</h3>
			
			<p>Speaking generally, bartenders know what's up. They see a very colorful crowd every night, hear crazy drunken stories all the time, and are usually local. They have the insider perspective that I always love to see wherever I go. Case in point: My friend J and I were in Bruges, Belgium when we had a fascinating encounter with a few Belgian bartenders. </p>

			<img class="centerimg" src="images/brugesbeer.jpg" alt="a brown bar counter with a glass with red liquid, a pile of bottle caps, a glass with brown liquid, a couple small red cups with candles inside, and a couple taps behind" title="Bar Counter in Bruges">

			<p>The first thing to know is that EVERYONE hates cleaning dishes, and if you offer to help out with some of their more menial tasks, they'll know that you see them as a real person and not just a server and they will be your friend and take you out to bars that are literally underground until 6 in the morning. and then you really get to see local culture.</p>

		<article class="traveltips clearfix" id="goat">
			
			<h2>April 9, 2015</h2>
			
			<h3>Stay out after midnight - you might see a goat. </h3>
			
			<p>I understand if you're a morning person and prefer to go to bed early so that you can get ahead of the lines in busy cities and make full use of your limited hours there. All the best to you. But for those of you who aren't like that, those young, energetic, social butterflies: stay out late. Go to bars, especially those on small, busy streets where the bars are so full that their patrons are spilling out onto the street, their merriment filling the night. This is where you can meet the locals, experience the culture, maybe even get wind of a city secret or two.</p>

			<img class="centerimg" src="images/tourscenter.jpg" alt="darkening sky, peaked roofs on colored houses, many chairs and tables under big white umbrellas" title="Tours at Night">

			<p>As for the goat, I met that delightful creature in Tours, France, just after midnight. A bunch of friends and I were at a bar right in the center of town, and everything was so alive. Looking at everyone out partying, you'd think it was noon, not midnight. All of a sudden, some girls further down my table started laughing and pointing behind me. When I turned, I saw an old man walking down the street - already unusual, as the average age was about 25 - but that's not all: he was walking his goat.</p> 
			<p>His goat.</p> 
			<p>Apparently, this guy was something of a celebrity, because he went around greeting everyone like he did this every night, and complied gracefully when people like my roommate went to take their picture with his goat. The goat wasn't quite so amenable to fame, as witnessed by his horns in my roommate's ass in response to her desire to have a picture with him.</p>
