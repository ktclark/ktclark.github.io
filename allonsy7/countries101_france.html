			<p>France had an absolute monarchy from the Middle Ages until 1789, when the people had a revolution and overthrew the monarchy, beheaded almost all the aristocracy, and installed the first republic based on the ideas Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, or  Liberty, Equality, and Brotherhood. Actually, the same philosophy and even some of the same philosophers inspired both the French and American Revolutions.</p>

			</a>
			
			<p>However, unlike the American Revolution, which led to a constitution that hasn't been drastically changed since its ratification in 1788, France has had 5 different constitutions since its revolution, to accompany the 5 republics they've had since that time. (There were also a couple imperial periods thrown in there, hence Napolean, but they don't like to think of that quite so much.)</p>

			<h2>Transportation</h2>
			<img class="left" src="images/tgv.jpg" alt="a picture of a French TGV (very fast train)" title="French TGV">
			<p>Trains can be confusing for people who don't use them in everyday life. Aka, Americans. And the French train system, the SNCF, or the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer (the French National Railroad Company), can be pretty strict, even if you're an American who is completely new to everything train.</p>
			<p>There are two kinds of trains in France, the TGV, Train Grande Vitesse, and the TER, Transport Express Régional (Regional Express). The TGVs are very fast, getting up to 200 miles/hour (322 km/h), and make few, if any, stops between the origin and terminus which, more often than not, is Paris. The downside is that they can be much more expensive. TERs are the cheaper option, but they go more slowly and stop frequently.</p> 
			<p> For an example of the time difference between these two, consider the route between Paris and Lyon, a distance of 289 miles (465km): A TGV will get you there in about 2 hours and cost around 100&euro; while a TER, the intercities train, will take around 5 hours and cost 50-60&euro;. I should note that train prices vary based on time of day, time of the year, how far ahead you reserve your place, your age, and whether or not you have any kind of membership card. </p>
			<p>Trains tend to be a much less stressful way of traveling, if you know what you're doing. To begin, there's no train station TSA, so you can arrive at the station even 2 minutes before your train leaves and still catch it. Probably. Depending on the size of the station.</p> 
			<p>Maybe don't try that in Paris.</p> 
			<p>Anyway, the process once you've arrived at the station can scare people who don't speak French. Here are some basic steps, assuming you've already gotten your ticket.</p> 

			<a class="fancybox" rel="gallery2" href="images/departureboard.jpg" title="Departure Board at Paris Gard du Nord">
				<img class="centerimg" src="images/departureboard.jpg" alt="a big, black bulletin board with the title 'Departure' in French, English, and German, and then lists departure times, destinations, train numbers, platform, and notes" title="Departure Board at Paris Gare du Nord">
			</a>

			<p><bold>First, locate the monitor or billboard with the list of departing trains (Départs)</bold>, and look for your train number and/or the departing time and/or the final destination. Be careful when looking at destination, because they'll only list the final destination of the train. If you're getting off somewhere in the middle, your destination won't be up there. It's safest to just look for the train number.</p>
			<p>Once you've found your train on the list, scan right to the column that says "Voie", or Platform, and it'll tell you at which platform your train will arrive. Some train stations have platform numbers, and some have letters, but it all means the same thing. Then follow the signs that direct you to the platform number/letter.</p> 
			<p>The voie is usually only shown 10-20 minutes before the train arrives, maybe even less if it's not a usual terminus town (ie, not Paris), so don't panic if you've arrived an hour beforehand and your voie isn't shown yet. Or just don't arrive an hour beforehand.</p>

			<a class="fancybox" rel="gallery1" href="images/sncftraininside.jpg" title="Inside of an SNCF Train">
				<img class="right" src="images/sncftraininside.jpg" alt="pairs of orange and purple seats on both sides of a train, a path of gray carpet between them, well-lit overhead storage space" title="Inside of an SCNF Train">
			</a>

			<p>Follow the signs that direct you to the platform number/letter. Then you gotta find your voiture, or car. Your ticket wlll have the number of your car on the right. If you don't see "voiture" and "place" (seat number) on your ticket, it should say which class you're in, and that your train is a TER where they're much less stringent on seating. If you're in a TER, just go to any of the cars that have your class number written on the window and try to sit in a seat that hasn't been reserved. If a seat has been reserved, it'll be written above the seat the last number of the traveller and at which stop they're getting on the train.</p>
			<p>Anyway, for a TGV: find the number of your car on the ticket, and then walk along the platform until you see that number written on the window of the train car. This process actually varies a lot with the station and the particular train. Some stations are great and have a display of how the train will be laid out on the platform, then you can go stand by where your car will arrive. This is more common at stations that aren't terminus stations because they want to get passengers on the train more quickly when it's just passing through.</p>
			<p>Something else that happens occasionally: the order of the cars isn't always what you would call logical. I've seen trains where the order of the cars is [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [food car] [12] [11] [10] [9] [8] [7]. So if you worry about your counting skills or the mystery of the disappearing train car, it's not you. It's them.</p> 
			<p>For non-terminus stations, if the train isn't quite there, you can chill until it arrives. Some very high-tech stations have display monitors with the setup of the arriving train, and then you can stand by where your car will be, but if not, don't panic. You'll make it. The car numbers are marked in the windows, and you can ask the people in caps and gray and purple suits "où est la voiture [number]," if you have trouble. </p>
			<p>Once you're in the car, look for your seat number, which will either be on the side of the seat or on the ceiling. If you have big luggage, there are usually spots at the ends of the car, sometimes even in the middle, if the train is really fancy. There's usually overhead space, which you should use for smaller baggage, but try do try to not be an asshole and take up all the space with your stuff.</p>

		<h2>Language Basics</h2>
		<section class="clearfix"id="language">	
			<article id="languagenotes">
				<h3>A few notes about the French language:</h3>
				<p><span class="languagestart">when a word ends with a consonant, it's not pronounced</span> unless there's an e after it. Speaking generally, of course. For example,"je pars," I leave, is pronounced "zheu par," but if you take a different mode of that, "je parte," you pronounce it "zheu part."</p>
				<p><span class="languagestart">yes, the r's sound a bit like hacking and gagging</span> but still try to not hit them too hard. and really don't roll them, that just gets confusing.</p>
				<p><span class="languagestart">there's a formal and informal way to address people.</span> the general rule is that if someone is older and/or of a higher standing than you (ie, a boss), use the formal version. otherwise stick with the informal. just to make it trickier, the formal way of addressing people is also the way of addressing multiple people. For example, "vous mangez," can either mean "you eat, Mr. President" or "you guys eat, you 10 homeless cats."</p>
				<p><span class="languagestart">French is one of those languages with masculine/feminine nouns</span>, so when you're writing, you really gotta remember where to add silent e's at the end of words and which form of an adjective to use. When you're speaking, generally an adjective that corresponds to a feminine noun will have a harder consonant at the end of the word. For example, "He is strong," is "il est fort," or "eel ay for," and "she is strong" is "elle est forte," or "el ay fort".</p>
				<p><span class="languagestart">In that same vein, don't use the female form of animals that are usually masculine.</span> "Cat", or "chat" ("shah") is masculine in French, as is pig, "cochon" ("ko-shoh(n)"), and dog, "chien", ("she-eh(n)"). I know it's tempting to call to a cute little female kitty a "chatte," but this actually ends up translating to "pussy." "Chienne" is "bitch," and "cochonne" is "slut." Just to name a few. It's like the French designed their language to make enthusiastic anglophones sound vulgar.</p>
				<p><span class="languagestart">There are lots of ways to greet people.</span> one thing my textbooks never mentioned: yes, "bonjour" is used to say "hello," but it literally translates to "good day," and so you only use that during the day. when it gets to evening and later, you say "bonsoir," which translates to "good evening."</p>
				<p><span class="languagestart">you gotta do math to count.</span> the french got lazy halfway through inventing numbers. that or they'd had too much wine, and didn't feel like coming up with new numbers after 60. so 70 translates to sixty-ten, 80 is four-twenty, and 90 is four-twenty-ten. i've been told that in belgium they've come up with septante for 70 and nonante for 90, but i've never actually heard it, so don't quote me on that. and now go add "calculator" to your packing list. </p>
