			<h2>April 28, 2014</h2>

			<p>We saw some last sights and took some last pictures of things like the princess statue, the Parliament building, Magrit Bridge and Magrit Island, and the Shoe Monument. the Shoe Monument is a touching and terribly sad monument to the Jews who were thrown into the river during the Nazi Occupation. </p>

			<p>Last minute gems before heading to the airport: we found trdlos, postcards, and pictures inside St. Stephen's Basilica.</p>

			<p>On the bus to the airport, there was a guy reading Cloud Atlas standing next to us at the back of the bus. Cloud Atlas is one of my favorite movies and such an incredible book, so seeing someone else read it in a country halfway across the world made me a little happier inside. But this disappeared pretty quick at the airport: I forgot to take my Granny's pocket knife out of my carry-on backpack and I would have lost entirely except the man checking my stuff was incredibly nice and helped me to call my check bag back so that I could put it in there and not lose an heirloom. Course, as I waited at the check-in desk, a fairly cranky English lady was not at all happy that I was "cutting in line," and made an unnecessariliy big deal out of me taking a minute of the man's time. Of course, because of this, I would have had one hell of a time catching the flight, sprinting all the way down the airport terminal, BUT we were on RyanAir and the flight left 2 hours late, so I really had no problem. The downside of the flight being delayed so long was that we didn't actually have time to get a quick bus to the tower of Pisa before going the rest of the way to Florence. Another downside: there was another thunderstorm as we were in the bus on the way to Florence and apparently too much rain for whatever waterproofing the bus had and our bags got soaked. </p>

			<p>When we got to Florence, we had perfect timing to catch the bus from the train station Santa Maria Novella to the apartment in Florence, but then we missed the stop by one, and the owner, Guido, didn't respond to us at first so we worried that we'd have to sleep outside, even made a plan to make off with the discarded mattresses down the street, but in the end the apartment was entirely worth it. It was homey and incredibly spacious with a bed in the loft and guitars that we were welcome to play, not to mention a clean and fully functional kitchen with a dining table like I've always dreamed of: a glass surface with a brilliantly chaotic assortment of pictures and postcards because the glass and the wood foundation of the table. Of course, we didn't actually have food to cook yet or to eat on this amazing table, and since it was late, most everywhere was closed except for a cheap chinese place about a 10-minute walk toward the center of town. we had all the luck.</p> 
		</article>

		<article class="blogpost">
			<h2>April 27, 2014</h2>

			<p>After a night like that we got a late start, leaving the apartment around 11:30. We were headed to the bathhouses, but I hadn't brought my swimsuit so we stopped by a flea market for me to search for one and found a lot of cool graffiti. Not quite so much as in Barcelona, but still fantastic. </p>

			<p>Going to the bathhouse was such a great experience. Turns out, they anticipated people not having swimsuits and I was able to rent one for a small fee. They asked for a deposit, but after I got it back it ended up costing the equivalent of 10 euros. The downside was that it made me look like the Jolly Green Giant's daughter, the Jolly Red Lifeguard. Despite that, the day went on. We spent a little over an hour napping in the pool outside, then we bounced around 8 or 9 baths of various temperatures and mineral compositions fro another hour and a half. I wondered aloud what gave one of the baths its greenish tint, and J answered, "some kind of minerals," but I heard "some kind of noodle," which led to a joke that persisted for the rest of our time together: "Baby noodle don't move that fast," said in the "honey badger don't give a fuck," voice.</p>

			<p>I noticed two things during our afternoon at the baths: people all come in their own, unique shape, and women are beautiful. I've never felt sexually attracted to any women, but we're just such aesthetically pleasing creatures. I suspect that, for some men, it's this admission coupled with a complete ignorance of the inner workings of women that draws them inexorably to us.</p>

			<p>We walked back from the baths to the apartment, taking in the sights of Budapest on our last night in the city. We had our eye for trdlos, the Czech pastry, but didn't find any open, cheap stands, so we left that til the day after. Instead, we stopped at this outdoor market and got langos, fried dough with garlic, and it was SO GOOD. So much for our day of cleansing. </p>

			<p>After langos, we temporarily parted ways, J to the apartment and Madison and I to the synagogue to take pictures. We met back up outside the apartment, 3 long flights of stairs up, for a delicious dinner of mexican food followed by more palinka, because Madison hadn't tried it yet. My dinner ended up being a mexican-hungarian fusion: meat and cheese quesadillas with hungarian mixed vegetables, topped off with a medium hot sauce. For palinka, at our favorite little caf&#233 "Hung(a)ry?" I didn't order anything because I was worried about money (needlessly, it turns out), but the lady still brought me a little sampler. The method was really cool, too; She brought a clear alcohol in a fancy little glass and water in a shot glass next to it, then poured the flavoring by tipping the full bottle into a tiny chamber attached to the nozzle (in order to measure out the right amount, I think), then pouring that particular amount of liquid into the glass with the clear alcohol. It was quite the experience.</p>

			<p>Something fairly important that I forgot to mention: while we were at dinner, we noticed a guy at the end of the street who was wearing only a towel, and even that fell off quickly. When we left the restaurant, he was in the process of being detained by the Budapest police, who were surprisingly gentle, because he had apparently been rubbing his balls on things at a nearby restaurant. </p>

			<p>What a way to end the night.</p>
		</article>

			<h2>April 26, 2014</h2>

			<p>We started the day by moving out of the hostel to an airbnb and met J's friend Madison there. It was a surprisingly big apartment right down the street from St. Stephen's Basilica, which was enormous and gorgeous and we took a million pictures there. She showered and freshened up because she'd spent the previous night in an airport, then we got lunch at a cute little place one street over called "Hung(a)ry?" Because they're so clever.</p>

			<p>After lunch, we rushed over to a free walking tour. There were 4 potential guides, but only one who introduced himself as "Norbert, like the dragon from Harry Potter," so I persuaded Madison and J to scoot over so that we'd fall under his group when they drew the invisible lines down the crowd. Also, there was an adorable golden retriever in our group, so Madison was happy, too. Norbert turned out to be a really good guide (and surprisingly muscular, as we realized when he took of his jacket), and we even got a chance for some more-or-less private flirting time with him b/t two stops on the tour. </p>

			<p>After the tour, Madison napped while J and I watched funny youtube videos, mostly Adam Hills. Then we got groceries for breakfast and pre-gaming later on, then we went to dinner right down the street from the apartment, then went back and pregamed to 10 fingers. Madison won with "I've never burped while making out," which got both me and J out. And after the game, we got all prettied up and went out to these special Budapest bars called Ruin Bars, which are old buildings that were war bunkers or warehouses or even detainment cells that have been appropriated and redecorated in all kinds of quirky manners to create a young, liberated, and sometimes rebellious atmosphere. We drank lots of Hungarian beer, J bought a carrot off a random girl selling them at 2 in the morning, after double-checking that there were no drugs (it was especially funny because Madison was in the bathroom during this whole transaction, so for her, the carrot magically appeared from nowhere), then we got back to the apartment around 3 in the morning, which was perfect for me. I'd been starving for a late, crazy night for so long because H&#233di’s always too tired to stay out late.</p>

			<h2>April 25, 2014</h2>

			<p>We got up way too early to catch the bus to Budapest, and since we were going back to the same bus station where we had arrived, we tried to duplicate the tram lines we'd taken that first morning, but we lost the tram #14. Just, poof. So we improvised the second half of the the route to the station. Then, after we'd arrived at the station, J realized that she'd bought her ticket for the wrong day! After much panic and last-minute rearranging, she managed to get a ticket on a later bus into Budapest. </p>

			<p>When I arrived in Budapest, alone in a country with a ridiculous language that no other language even resembles, I had one hell of a time getting to the hostel. J had given me instructions before I left her at the bus station in Prague, but the instructions left out the bit where the hostel is actually just one floor of a building housing other enterprises as well, and thus the only mark was a tiny, handwritten note by the doorbell.</p>

			<p>After finally relaxing for a bit and treating my wounded feet (new shoes-itis), I went to find J at the bus station. We'd said that we'd meet at the hostel, but seeing as how getting to the hostel was so complicated, I thought that I'd meet her at the station and lead her back. Turns out, though, that we passed each other on the way and I waited at the bus station for an hour for nothing. </p>

			<p>B/t hostel and bus station: stopped at an atm to take out some money and the exchange rate was even huger than in Prague. Prague was about 20 crowns/1 dollar, 27 crowns/1 euro, and Budapest was about 250 florints/1 dollar, 300 florints/1 euro. And "florint" abbreviates "ft," which just made me thing that everything on various menus was enormous. Anyway, I took out 20,000 ft with only a vague idea of the exchange rate at that point, and the goddamn machine gave me a single bill. I knew I had to break it, so I went next door to a bakery, and the poor girl looked terrified when she saw a bill for 20,000 ft. Must be huge. She did manage to make change, but it took a while, cuz the thing I bought cost 450.</p>

			<p>After finding J at the hostel and finally paying, we went to look for dinner and found a lovely restaurant right near the river where the waiter was kinda pushy about what he brought us: we ordered beers, he brought us the huge size and honey-flavored palinka, a hungarian liqueur kinda like schnapps, to wash it it down. The food was delicious, though. We share a meat-filled pancake &#224 la paprika sauce (they really like paprika in Hungary), then I had a delicious beef/noodle concoction. It was a fine meal, but it took us forever to get the check cuz both waiters kept forgetting us. So we entertained ourselves by peeking in on a date where the guy talked incessantly about an ex and the woman clearly had no interest in being there. </p>

			<p>After dinner, we walked across the Magrit Bridge and took lots of pictures of what we later learned where to Parliament Building, the Castle, and the St. Mathis Church, all of which are well-illuminated and gorgeous at night. </p>

			<h2>April 24, 2014</h2>

			<p>J and I tried to go to the castle in the morning, walked up a mile of hill and stairs, but it was closed for diplomatic meetings. I'm still a little curious about what state secrets may have been exchanged in that meeting, but I'm sure that whatever conspiracy I concoct in my head is juicier than what really happened. So, thwarted and sore, headed back downtown, grabbed a couple beers from a grocery store and headed to an island park in the middle of the Vltava where we lay in the sun. The little things in life really make you happiest. Like the right to have an innocent drink in public. </p>

			<h2>April 23, 2014</h2>

			<p>After sleeping in, we explored a little more around old town, then the Jewish Quarter, Wenceslas Square, and had a beautiful little promenade next to the river, which I found out later is called Vltava. </p>

			<p>When we were at Wenceslas Square, we first discovered a Starbucks, then an H&M right next to it. White girls' dream. and J finds H&M in every city that we go to. We got drinks, and then popped into H&M to find J a white shirt for white night in Florence a week later. The funny thing is, the Starbucks managed to spell my name right, with a 'K' and all, and managed to misspell J's name. </p>

			<p>After this, we wandered around a bit more, then went back to the hostel to organize ourselves and rest, because we planned to go out that night. Unfortunately, we only managed to go as far as a brilliant hamburger place, accompanied by incredible and unpronouncable Czech beer. Then as we were wandering around on full stomachs, we were more motivated to find bed than drinks. </p>

			<h2>April 22, 2014</h2>

			<p>It took a bit to get installed at the hostel cuz we got lost (because Czech), and then we explored old town a bit and I finally saw the astronomical clock of Prague. As we were meanderingback to the hostel for dinner, we kept hearing a noise that sounded a little bit like thunder, but I convinced the two of use that it was just the tram.</p>
	
			<p>Yeah, I was wrong.</p>

			<p>The storm started slowly, and we thought we could take shelter under a tree and wait it out, but then it got harder, so we moved to a bigger tree, made friends with a couple of Dutch women, and then it started HAILING, and we knew no makeshift shelter would cut it. So we ran into this grandiose, theater-looking building, but it was too late; we were already soaked.</p>

			<p>After waiting out the rest of the storm, we minced our way back to the hostel on squelching shoes, spent about an hour drying off and changing, and then went to dinner close to the hostel.</p>

			<h2>April 21, 2014</h2>

			<p>ALMOST missed the bus cuz the hostel lady gave us terrible information, and then once on the bus, we were surrounded by loud obnoxious Italians, but the Tulip fields were beautiful and J and i went into full tourist mode. Took SO MANY pictures, requesting pics in a certain pose or instructing the other to turn this way or that, by these flowers or those, and hold on, we have to wait for this other group of tourists to pass so that we can take the picture from the ideal angle, alright now, smile! Perfect. </p>

			<p>That was pretty much our whole morning. </p>

			<p>Then we spent the afternoon prepping to leave (we had a night bus to Prague), and FINALLY getting around to our space cakes. I apparently have have a stupidly slow metabolism, cuz I'd waited an hour and a half after eating the first half, still felt nothing, ate the rest, got SO HIGH in the restaurant where me and J had dinner that night. Unfortunately, it pretty much wore off before the bus.</p>

			<p>The bus didn't end up being as bad as most night buses are. It took a stupidly long time to check in, cuz we had to do it at the desk instead of directly on the bus, but there were no crying babies and after half the bus got off at Frankfurt, we each had two seats to ourselves. </p>

			<p>Arrived in Santiago before the sun came up and, since I was alone and had no idea how to navigate the city, I decided to wait at the station until there was any light by which I could read street signs. I arrived at the hostel with some difficulties, and then the woman who ran the hostel, who kept her records by hand, had written down the wrong day for my arrival date and still made it seem like a favor that she found a bed for me after I'd shown her my reservation confirmation that I'd printed out. </p>

			<h2>March 1, 2014</h2>

			<p>J and Katie left this morning to go to Morocco. I'm looking forward to going to Morocco at some point in my life, but at a point when I have more money in order to get back on my own accord. Unfortunately, this is not currently the case. I still have 5 days left before going back to Clermont-Ferrand to see my boyfriend. His job keeps him quite literally for days on end. Either that or he's secretly juggling 5 girls. So, I decided to go up to Santiago, Galicia for a couple days, and my train left that night and I spent the day doing a whirlwind walk around the city to see iconic landmarks that we hadn't gotten to: Cybele's Palace, Biblioteca National, the Archeological Museum, Alfonso IX statue, and an ancient Egyptian building. Then, when it got dark I headed to the train station to wait out the next couple hours. </p>

			<h2>February 28, 2014</h2><div id="februarylink"></div>

			<p>We spent much longer than usual hanging out at the hostel today, but I would argue that we had good reason to: there was a wood-chopping contest below us in Plaza Mayor.  I had never seen anything like it. They made a sectioned off section of the square with an improvised wooden fence, and then on one side, there was a group of dancing women accompanied by an instrument that sounded vaguely like an oboe, and on the other side there were 4 very large, muscular men, two teams of 2, who worked their way chopping through three short, stout logs side-by-side. The best we could figure was that they were trying to see who could make it through the three logs faster than the other team. </p>

			<p>When we were able to tear ourselves away from this fascinating event, we spent a few hours at the museum the Prado, which, as far as I could tell, was akin to the Louvre of Spain. On our way back from that, we were inundated with very talented busking groups, included a 10-person mariachi band, a dulcimer duet, and a folk band consisting of a tambourine, a harmonica, a bass, and two guitars, one of whom lost a string halfway through and continued on. I was very impressed. </p>

			<h2>February 27, 2014</h2>

			<p>Madrid is much smaller than Barcelona. </p>

			<p>We arrived at about 8 into the train station, then took the metro to Plaza Mayor, to our hostel, which was actually just a large apartment run by a small, blonde man who always seemed to be stoned. </p>

			<p>After more hot chocolate and churros, we caught a free walking tour in the late morning where we learned all kinds of crazy things about Madrid. By European standards, it's considered a young city because it has no Roman roots, but rather was originally a Moorish city, perhaps even Celtic, if the origins the name are correct that Christians took over in 1085. Funnily enough, the Christians legends from that time suggest that it was actually the Moors who attacked and tried to take the city from the Christians. Also, the legend behind the main Cathedral in Madrid, Santa Maria Almudena, contradicts history. The legend goes that there was a statue of Santa Maria was hidden in a wall to hide it from the invading Moors, and once the Moors were expelled from the city, the wall cracked upon to reveal the statue, and then on that site, they built the cathedral. Two problems: the cathedral we can see today sits on the site of a medieval mosque, and history tells us it was the Christians attacking, not the Moors. A funny peek into the victors who write history.</p>

			<p>After this, we had a very nice lunch for surprisingly cheap. It seemed to us that in Spain, lodging and food came relatively cheap while museums and public transport were where we spent all our money. We ended our day by engaging in the brilliant spanish tradition, the siesta, and then taking advantage of the free entrance to the museum the Reina Sophia between 7 and 9.</p>

			<h2>February 26, 2014</h2>

			<p>We checked out in the morning and then made our way down to the beach. On our way, we accidentally ran across a HUGE flea market where Katie found a great pair of leggings with every color Crayola ever imagined. Then we got burgers, large cans of beer and went to have a feast on the beach. A little ways down the beach, we found a jungle gym. You know, it's always so much fun to revert back to childhood, and even better with a huge can of cheap Spanish beer in you. </p>

			<p>We came down by walking around the Gothic Quarter, and ended up once again at a caf&#233 to indulge in hot chocolate and churros. This caf&#233 was a nice, brightly colored caf&#233 where all of the waiters young, attractive men. We didn't know whether or not that was on purpose or if that was just the entire pool of young men in Spain. A new, incredibly attractive waiter walked in halfway through our snack wearing motorcycle gear. An fyi for guys out there: for a large portion of young women, motorcycles make you really hot. He quickly became our favorite, so much so that we indulged in whimsy and came up with a back story for him: His name was Santiago and, although he'd once been a student of business, on track for a successful and lucrative career, he was just a little too much of a dreamer, so his girlfriend left him for someone more ambitious and, in the throes of despair, he left the business world to pursue his real dream of becoming an artist. Now he owns a motorcycle, a small studio apartment on the top floor of a run-down building from which he has a view of the sea, and supports himself and his art by being a waiter. </p>

			<p>We spent the last of our time there getting tapas on the recommendation of Felipe, and we even brought him back a plate because he and his hostel had been so great. And then we had to say goodbye to Barcelona as we boarded our night train to Madrid.</p>

			<h2>February 25, 2014</h2>

			<p>Barcelona is filled to the brim with things to accidentally stumble upon. We were making our way back to the Sagrada Familia today when we found an old hospital with lovely Middle-Eastern-looking roofing tiles that is now mostly a testament to times past. It was a gorgeous day out and a gorgeous accidental find. </p>

			<p>Afterward, we went down the street to finally go inside the Sagrada Familia. Incidentally, it's quite expensive to visit. It's privately owned and they're always trying to raise money to finish the construction after 100 years, so it makes sense, but still, 14 euros is a steep price for a cathedral, even for one which such incredible architecture. </p>

			<p>To continue our Gaudi day, we headed over to the Park de Graal. On the way there, though, we decided to stop for lunch. We found an adorable square down the hill from the park with a few restaurants around it. Because it was the end of the lunch hour, they were trying to get rid of the extra food they'd cooked, and not only did my plate of spaghetti end up ENORMOUS, but we also got an entire bottle of pretty good red wine despite having ordered only a glass each. </p>

			<p>We got to the park and discovered that, to go into the section with the lovely tiled benches, we had to pay another 14 euro, so we just wandered around the upper part, caught ear of a couple buskers on guitar, and took some lovely, if cheesy, flower pictures. </p>

			<h2>February 24, 2014</h2>

			<p>Today involved more promenading in the deceptively large Barcelona. We started out on Avenue de Roblas, which is essentially the Barcelonian Champs-&#201lys&#233e, or a wide main street lined with expensive boutiques. We then found a lovely indoor market for a lunch of fruit and tacos followed by a jaunt out to the harbor where they have a whole mall on the water. </p>

			<p>After that lovely start, we had an even better treat: the Barcelona chocolate museum. The ticket was the wrapper of a small chocolate bar that you could open once you'd entered and munch on as you made your way through the exhibit, which included a bit of history and then incredible statues made only of chocolate. And after that we continued the chocolate streak with hot chocolate and churros, which, fortuitously, is a Spanish specialty. Chocolate & churros, tapas, and sangria. What a country.</p>

			<h2>February 23, 2014</h2>

			<p>I got into the Barcelona bus station at about 4:30 in the morning, which was an hour before we were supposed to get in, and the bus driver never made an announcement where we were, which means I almost missed getting off the bus in the right city. He actually started driving away while I was getting my shoes back on! I don't even know where the next stop would have been. Anyway, after getting in at 4:30, I waited for J and Katie for an hour, and then we worked our way to the hostel on the outskirts of the city and arrived about 7 in the morning and woke up the Hungarian on duty in the hostel. Then we left our bags, set off to wander around the city, and accidentally found ALL the things: the Sagrada Familia, the Estrella Dam brewery, Cintadell Park with a fabulous Australian lady who taught us how to make giant bubbles with soap and ropes, the Barcelonian Arc de Triomf, and finally the Mediterranean, where we had a lovely, if expensive lunch. Made up for the man on the beach who made us buy coconuts for him. And no, that's not a euphemism. He shoved them in our hands and then because we touched them, they were contaminated and we had to pay for them. Never fall for that. </p>
		
			<p>After sleeping off a wonderful meal in the sun on the beach, we trekked back to the hostel to check in. The way back seemed a LOT longer than it had that morning. Of course, we walked past an incredible abandoned site covered in high-quality street art, which is one of my favorite things to take pictures of. Other than sunsets. Which I like way too much.</p>

			<p>Another gem: we walked past this building: [penis building picture] I don't think it needs any explanation. </p>

			<p>Back at the hostel, we met a hilarious, international group of hosteleers including people from Hungary, Uruguay, France, England, and Portugal. One of them, Christian, played us a song that he'd written that morning on the metro and called everyone “darling.” Another, Filipe, had recently had a haircut from a good friend of his who happened to be drunk at the time and ended up bald save for an off-center rattail. And the Hungarian guy that we'd woken up that morning [probably did cool things that I might remember if I come back to this.]</p>
